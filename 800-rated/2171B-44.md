## Problem Name:  Yuu Koito and Minimum Absolute Sum
## Link: https://codeforces.com/contest/2171/submission/350790710

## Difficulty: Easy

## Core Idea
-You can only change the '-1' from the array.
-Absolute value of the sum of the difference array must be minimized.

## My Approach
- Tried to calculate the whole difference array insted of just checking the first and the last element.

## Reflection / Better Approach
- for problems using difference array and minimizing the sum of that array...just minimize the outer most values difference.
- The first thing that should have come to my mind was minimizing sum of difference array can be done my minimizing just the difference of the first and the last element.
- if the first value is '-1'.. I change it to the last value and vice-versa to make the difference sum minimum.
- then change the rest '-1's to 0
