## Problem Name: Shizuku Hoshikawa and Farm Legs
## Link: https://codeforces.com/contest/2171/submission/350156661

## Difficulty: Easy

## Core Idea
- How many different configurations of 4 and 2 can add up to n.
- n is even number.
- if n is odd.. print 0

## My Approach
- I added 1 to the sum of configs every time the n can get divided by 4 with no remainders.

## Mistakes / Pitfalls
- 
## Reflection / Better Approach
- If I need different configs(for 2 different numbers), I should count the max times the bigger number can be used... then just
  decrease one by one while filling the gaps with the smaller number.
- for this problem the number of cows are 0 to floor(n/4)... so the number of configs are floor(n/4)+1 //+1 because we have to count 0.
