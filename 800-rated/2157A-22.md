## Problem Name:  Dungeon Equilibrium
## Link: https://codeforces.com/contest/2157/submission/350680407

## Core Idea
- count the frequency of the unique values and sum them to determine how many elements can be deleted to make the number of occurances
  (frequency) and the value of the element same.
- if freq > value ..add (freq-value) to the sum
- if freq < value .. add the occ to the sum
## My Approach
- made 2 additional arrays, one holding the unique values and other the frequency of the unique values.

## Mistakes / Pitfalls
-didn't sort the array at first.(sorting was necessary)***
- didn't keep count of the elements of the unique array at first.
- tried bubble sort which make the time complexity O(n^2) insted of O(nlogn).

## Reflection / Better Approach
- use stl sort() for sorting
- could have used vector/ sets to easily do it(haven't learned them yet)
- could have done only using one array.
- For these kinds of frequency related problems:
- whole logic could be done with one loop after sorting:
-Sort → count consecutive equal → process per distinct value
